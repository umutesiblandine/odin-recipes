			<li>Chop your onion, tomatoes,slice or grate your cheese,break your eggs into a bowl and mix with a fork or whisk</li>
			<li>Heat the pan on a medium heat and pour the eggs in</li>
			<li>Lower the heat when you see the eggs change colour at the edge as they firm up (2-3 mns)</li>
			<li>Add the cheese to one side</li>
			<li>Add the sliced tomatoes on top</li>
